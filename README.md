# 🎧 Maestro
Maestro is a project that enables you to control Spotify media player using hand gestures. You can currently pause, play and skip songs by doing hand gestures on your webcam
## Technologies
I used **Python, Opencv, Mediapipe**

## 🚀 Setup
1. Download or clone the repository

2. Change directory
```
cd Maestro
``` 

3. create a conda environment 
```
conda create -n maestro
```

4. Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Open Spotify

6. Run main script
```
python3 main.py
```

## 👨‍🏫 Usage
When the script is executed, a window will pop-up showing your webcam. To control yout media player, simply raise your hand and do some gestures.

The gestures currently available are:
<pre>
✋: raise LEFT hand       -> pause song
✋: raise RIGHT hand      -> play song
✌🏼: peace sign LEFT hand  -> previous song
✌🏼: peace sign RIGHT hand -> next song 
</pre>
